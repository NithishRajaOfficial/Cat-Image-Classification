# Cat-Image-Classification

This Project is to classify the Image of Cat using Deep Learning in depth of Logistic Regression by <b>Nithish_Raja</b>

<b> Mathematical Implementation !!! </b>

* Build a logistic regression classifier to recognize  cats. This Project will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.

**You will learn to:**
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
    - Initializing parameters
    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
  
  **Points to Remember**

1. Preprocessing the dataset is important.
2. Implementing each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then built a model().
3. Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm.
